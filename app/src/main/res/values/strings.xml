The Unforgiven - Metallica

[Verse]

Am                    Em         D               Am
New blood joins this earth  and quickly he\'s sub-dued.
                         Em         D                      Am
Through constant pain disgrace, the young boy learns their rules.
                          Em       D                 Am
With time the child draws in this whipping boy done wrong.
                     Em           D                   Am
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and  on.
                   C             G        C               G
He knows,  oo, a  vow unto  his own that never from this day
      C                    G    E
 his will they\'ll take a - way.


[Chorus]

 <b>Am</b>        C               G           Em                          Am
What I\'ve felt, what I\'ve known never shined through in what I\'ve shown.
 Am   C          G          E                   Am
Never be. Never see. Won\'t see what might have been.
 Am        C               G           Em                          Am
What I've felt, what I've known,never shined through in what I've shown.
 Am    C          G        E            Am
Never free. Never me. So I dub the unforgiven.


[Verse]

 Am                  Em       D             Am
They dedicate their lives to running all of his
                        Em         D            Am
He tries to please them all, this bitter man he is
                         Em         D             Am
Throughout the life the same, he's battled constantly
                      Em     D              Am
This fight he cannot win. A tired man they see no longer cares.
     C            G           C           G
The old man then prepares to die regretfully
      C              G   E
That old man here is me.


[Chorus]

 Am        C               G           Em                          Am
What I've felt, what I've known never shined through in what I've shown.
 Am   C          G          E                   Am
Never be. Never see. Won't see what might have been.
 Am        C               G           Em                          Am
What I've felt, what I've known,never shined through in what I've shown.
 Am    C          G        E            Am
Never free. Never me. So I dub the unforgiven.
